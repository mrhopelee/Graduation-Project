## Buffers

NAN's `node::Buffer` helpers exist as the API has changed across supported Node versions. Use these methods to ensure compatibility.

### Nan::NewBuffer()

Allocate a new `node::Buffer` object with the specified size and optional data. Calls `node::Buffer::New()`.

Note that when creating a `Buffer` using `Nan::NewBuffer()` and an existing `char*`, it is assumed that the ownership of the pointer is being transferred to the new `Buffer` for management.
When a `node::Buffer` instance is garbage collected and a `FreeCallback` has not been specified, `data` will be disposed of via a call to `free()`.
You _must not_ free the memory space manually once you have created a `Buffer` in this way.
